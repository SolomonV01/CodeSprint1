What License did I use: Mozilla Public License Version 2.0

Why I chose it:
When I was first looking for Licenses I knew I wanted to go with something familiar and trustworthy while also looking for what worked best with my code. I ended up choosing the Mozilla Public License because of the Definitions, the License Grants and Conditions, and the Responsibilities. I believe their conditions to maintain this license are fair and would be fine for the formatting of my projects.

I want to first discuss the “Definitions” which clearly explain important aspects to the license and its user. It goes to elaborate on the contributor (in this case, me), who has made a creation, in my understanding. It mentions the “contribution” which is the created product/ project and how different versions can combine and fit together. Another important thing mentioned was how it wasn’t compatible with other licenses; since I wanted to keep my licensing process simple in the long run, I thought using a singular license wouldn’t affect my work negatively. Another great thing it mentioned was the “Patent Claims” of a contributor which, in open source code can be a difficult thing to navigate. By providing a guideline for patents and being open to the rules and information you give out to your users, Mozilla has given me a more reassuring path to licensing.

Along with the definitions, I want to mention the License Grants and Conditions. Here, is a thorough explanation of how you’re given a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license and the things you’re able to accomplish with it. It mentions the scope of the grant in great detail and allows you to plan around trademarks based on their specifications. And, as I believe every license should it elaborates on representation and fair use which has become a necessary thing to discuss in our modern era. The growth of the World Wide Web brings about more situations for guidance; ethics and morality should always be at the forefront of our guidelines.

Lastly, I want to talk about the Responsibilities section which includes the distribution of your source form and the distribution of a larger work in general. It’s important to explain the possibilities of your code while also realizing that there are limitations and requirements to follow to ensure that it’s up to par with the license and as a project in general.

Overall, these were the features that went into how I chose the Mozilla Public License Version 2.0.
